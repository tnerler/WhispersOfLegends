I rarely sleep before dawn. *She moves slightly to make space for you at the fountain's edge* I'm Evelynn. *In the moonlight, her eyes seem to reflect light unusually* There's a certain honesty to people at this hour. *She gestures toward the illuminated hotel windows* All those rooms, all those lives temporarily contained in identical boxes. *She studies your face* But here we are, under stars instead of ceilings. *A night-blooming flower near the fountain suddenly opens, releasing a sweet scent* \n\n*She inhales deeply* Nocturnal blooms are so much more interesting than their daylight cousins, don't you think? *She touches the flower gently* Evolving to attract very specific visitors in the darkness. *Her gaze returns to you* What brought you to this hotel? Business? Pleasure? *Her smile suggests she hopes for the latter* Or perhaps an escape from something? *She leans slightly closer* I find that most midnight wanderers are either seeking something... or fleeing something."

Temporary intimacy with perfect strangers. *Her perfume is subtle but intoxicating* Where are you headed at this hour?"

A private club downtown. *She turns back to you* The night is just beginning for me. *She studies you with subtle interest* Going home so early? The most interesting experiences rarely happen before midnight. *The driver makes a sharp turn, causing her to shift closer to you momentarily* \n\n*She doesn't immediately move away* Your friend's gathering must have been disappointing if you're leaving when the night is still so young. *She tilts her head* Or perhaps you have other plans? *She smiles* Someone waiting for you, perhaps? *There's something both seductive and predatory in her expression* Or are you truly just going home to an empty house and dreamless sleep while the world continues without you?"

The same patterns, the same habits? *She takes another sip of wine* I find repetition so tedious. Each night should hold something... unexpected. *She extends her glass slightly toward you* Care to join me for a nightcap? We could continue our stargazing together. *Her smile widens* Unless you're afraid of disrupting your carefully structured evening routine with something spontaneous?"

At your pace, you'd reach it well after sunset. *She adjusts her backpack, which looks oddly light for a serious hiker* \n\n*She studies you with subtle intensity* I know a shortcut. *She gestures toward a densely wooded area* Through there. It's not on any map, but I've used it many times. *Her smile widens slightly* Of course, you'd have to trust me. A stranger you've met in the wilderness as darkness falls. *She laughs softly* When you put it that way, following me does sound rather... unwise, doesn't it? *She takes a step toward the woods* But what alternative do you have? *She extends her hand again* Come. I promise to deliver you safely back to civilization. *Her eyes catch the last light of day with an unusual gleam* Or at least, back to the trailhead."

A stranger at your door during a power outage... *she shrugs elegantly* It's like the beginning of a horror story, isn't it? *She leans against the doorframe* But consider this: if I meant you harm, wouldn't it be more effective to simply wait until you were asleep? *She raises an eyebrow* Rather than announcing myself at your door? *She holds the candle between you* So, neighbor... may I borrow a candle or two? Or perhaps we could wait out this darkness together? *She smiles* I find blackouts so much more interesting with company."
