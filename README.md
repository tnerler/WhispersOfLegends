## 🎮 What is Champion Chronicles?

Champion Chronicles is an ambitious AI project that creates an interactive storytelling experience within the League of Legends universe. By collecting and processing champion lore from official sources, we're building an intelligent system that can:

- 📚 **Answer complex lore questions** with accurate citations
- 🤖 **Generate new stories** in the style of existing champion narratives  
- 🔍 **Explore character relationships** and timeline connections
- 💬 **Chat with champions** in their authentic voices
- 📊 **Provide confidence scores** for all information

## ✨ Key Features (Planned)

### 🕷️ **Comprehensive Data Collection**
- Official Riot Universe content scraping
- Community wiki integration
- Champion voice lines and quotes
- Legends of Runeterra card lore
- Reddit community discussions

### 🧠 **Advanced AI Capabilities**
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** for accurate responses
- **Confidence scoring** system for information reliability
- **Citation generation** with source tracking
- **Multi-modal analysis** (text, images, audio)

### 🌟 **Interactive Experience**
- Champion personality-based responses
